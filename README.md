## 3. Definition of Prompt Types
<p1>Prompt engineering plays a crucial role in the interaction between humans and AI models. In this experiment, two types of prompts are defined distinctly: *Naive Prompts, which are broad, unstructured, and lacking in detail, and **Basic Prompts*, which are clear, detailed, and structured to guide the model toward specific outputs. Understanding these distinctions allows us to appreciate how input structure affects the quality of AI-generated responses and helps in formulating prompts that align with desired outcomes.</p1><br>

## 4. Preparation of Multiple Test Scenarios
<p1>To ensure a diverse evaluation of ChatGPT’s capabilities, 18 test scenarios were meticulously prepared. These scenarios span a wide range of use cases, including creative writing, answering factual questions, summarization tasks, advice giving, technical programming, environmental analysis, and leadership suggestions. Each scenario includes both a naive and a basic prompt version. This diverse preparation ensures that the analysis covers different cognitive and creative capabilities of the model, providing a holistic view of prompt impact.</p1><br>

## 5. Running Experiments with ChatGPT
<p1>Each naive and basic prompt was separately fed into ChatGPT under controlled conditions. Care was taken to ensure that the only changing variable was the prompt structure, with the same model version and settings used throughout the experiment. The responses were carefully documented for each scenario, and multiple iterations were sometimes considered to observe consistency. This method provided a robust set of data for a fair comparative analysis.</p1><br>

## 6. Response Recording and Table Construction
<p1>The results from each experiment were systematically recorded in a comparison table. This table captured key attributes for every scenario, including the scenario name, the naive and basic prompts, the responses generated for each, and a qualitative analysis of the differences. This tabular format allowed for easy comparison and identification of trends across different scenarios, highlighting the significant impact of prompt structure on response quality.</p1><br>

<table>
<tr><th>S.No</th><th>Scenario</th><th>Naive Prompt</th><th>Basic Prompt</th><th>Naive Response</th><th>Basic Response</th><th>Analysis</th></tr>
<tr><td>1</td><td>Creative Story</td><td>Write a story.</td><td>Write a story about a dragon who becomes a chef in a medieval kingdom.</td><td>Random short story, unfocused.</td><td>Clear, imaginative story with a plot.</td><td>Basic prompt yields better structure and creativity.</td></tr>
</table><br>

## 7. Evaluation Parameters
<p1>The evaluation of ChatGPT’s responses was based on four main parameters: Quality (coherence and engagement level), Accuracy (factual correctness), Depth (level of detail and thoughtfulness), and Usefulness (practicality of the output). This multi-dimensional evaluation ensured a thorough understanding of how prompt clarity influences different aspects of AI-generated content.</p1><br>

<table>
<tr><th>Evaluation Parameter</th><th>Naive Prompting</th><th>Basic Prompting</th></tr>
<tr><td>Quality</td><td>Moderate</td><td>High</td></tr>
<tr><td>Accuracy</td><td>Medium</td><td>High</td></tr>
<tr><td>Depth</td><td>Low</td><td>High</td></tr>
<tr><td>Usefulness</td><td>Moderate</td><td>Very High</td></tr>
</table><br>

## 8. Scenario 1-6 Test Results
<p1>The first six scenarios showed a significant gap in performance between naive and basic prompts. Naive prompts often resulted in generic, superficial, or unfocused responses. In contrast, basic prompts led to outputs that were structured, relevant, and engaging. This pattern was especially evident in tasks like story generation, factual answering, and article summarization, where clarity of the initial prompt greatly influenced the depth of the AI's reasoning and creativity.</p1><br>

## 9. Scenario 7-12 Test Results
<p1>In scenarios such as providing study tips, offering career advice, and writing health recommendations, naive prompts elicited surface-level advice lacking in personalization.
